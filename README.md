# typeworm
Minimal keylogger and playbacker of logged keys.
## Why?
Because I want to record and play back my solutions to puzzle games so I only have to solve each puzzle once, instead of a thousand times or so. I'm looking at you, [Void Stranger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jo5v0yo1Mg), you silly-ass goose, you motherfucker.
## What?
This is a minimal keylogger and playbacker of logged keys, or so they say. _It's like a tapeworm for your keyboard!_
## How?
Be on Linux. Then compile and run the program with `sudo`. Make sure you be on Linux first.
